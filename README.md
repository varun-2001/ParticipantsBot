Two simple programs I wrote to automate the tedious task of texting and emailing all the particants. 
From requiring around 10 people to do this manually, the programs reduced it to just 1 person having to press run.

Things to know:
1. Doesn't alert you if the number doesn't have whatsapp.
2. Can't really add country codes intelligently yet.
3. Requires whatsapp web to be signed in
4. The email automation requires 'less secure apps' access to be turned on in google.
